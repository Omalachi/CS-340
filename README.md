### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?  
When writing programs, I focus on breaking the code into small, reusable parts that are easy to understand and modify. For example, in Project One, I built a CRUD Python module to handle database interactions. Instead of writing all the database code in one place, I organized it into functions like create, read, update, and delete. This made the code easier to maintain because if I needed to change how a database query worked, I only had to update one function.  

Using this module in Project Two, I connected the dashboard widgets to the database without duplicating code. The advantage of this approach was that the module could be reused across different parts of the project, saving time and reducing errors. In the future, I could use the same CRUD module for other projects that need database connections, just by adapting it to a new database or adding extra functionality.  

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?  
I start by understanding the problem and breaking it down into smaller parts. For Grazioso Salvare’s project, I looked at the requirements for the dashboard and database. I planned out how the database needed to store data and how the dashboard would interact with it. By focusing on the big picture first, I made sure all the pieces worked together before writing any code.  

This was different from previous assignments where I sometimes started coding right away without much planning. That approach led to mistakes and having to redo things later. Now, I use strategies like writing down the requirements, sketching out a design, and testing small pieces of the project before combining them. In the future, I’ll continue using this method to create databases or applications that meet client needs efficiently.  

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?  
Computer scientists solve problems by creating programs or systems that make tasks easier or more efficient. In this project, I helped Grazioso Salvare by building a dashboard that quickly filters and displays animals that meet their needs. This saves the company time and effort compared to manually searching through data.  

Work like this matters because it helps organizations focus on what they do best. For example, by automating data processing, Grazioso Salvare can spend more time rescuing animals and less time managing information. My work on this project shows how computer science can make a real difference in helping a company succeed.
